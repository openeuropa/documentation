<h1 align="center">The OpenEuropa Initiative</h1>

OpenEuropa is a [Directorate-General for Informatics (DIGIT)][1] initiative aiming at strengthening the adoption
of [open source][2] tools and practices in consolidating the European Institutions' web presence.

In order to achieve such a goal the OpenEuropa Initiative will focus on the following activities:

- Build, maintain and release loosely-coupled, reusable software [components](docs/openeuropa-components.md) , licensed under [EUPL-1.2][3].
- Build, maintain and release fully-fledged solutions for the European Institutions.
- Provide a high-level architecture overview of web-related information systems.
- Establish reusable technical governance guidelines.
- Contribute back to upstream open source projects.
